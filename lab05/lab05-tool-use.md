# Imaginative Use of Tool Calling 
the tool call can be used for many different things but the one interesting thing I am going to talk about is about how you can use it for data privacy. I am currently working for a AI company that is using an LLM to make sure the user does not put any private information into the chat bot. The LLM has tools that check for information like user names, medical number, and other important information you can think of. The tools look at the response and parse the data and sends an alert to the user to make sure they actually want to put that data into the chat bots.
