# Lab03: LLM Agent Development

## This Lab

In this lab you will create a basic DnD agent using `lab03_dnd_agent.py` that should allow a single player to play DnD with the Dungeon Master. You will write the basic code for the flow of the chat in `lab03_dnd_agent.py` based on the code in `demo_agent.py`. Your agent should take the player on an adventure. You can use various system prompts and model hyperparameters that you learned about in class to improve the agent. 

As you run `lab03_dnd_agent.py` remember to gracefully exit the program by typing '/exit' in the chat. This is crucial for grading purposes.

You will edit the file `lab03.md` with your reflections on the things that you tried and the effects that it had on the game experience. It is ok, as far as evidence of iterative improvement rubric goes, if your code was doing something right but by removing something it became worse as long as you document it. 

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the basic workflow of communication with an LLM model. 
2. Understand the input to an LLM as a series of messages and the message format.
3. Ability to use an appropriate model and model parameters to improve the chat experience.

## Intro to Ollama
Ollama is a tool that allows you to run large language models (LLMs) locally on your computer. It provides a simple command-line interface to interact with LLMs and can be used for various natural language processing tasks. Ollama supports a wide range of models that can be found in the [Ollama Library](https://ollama.com/library)

## Lab Task
1. Sign your name first in the `lab03_dnd_agent.py` file.
2. Complete the code in the file such you are able to converse with the agent based on the `demo_agent.py` file.
3. Ensure that the `attempts.txt` file is being generated by gracefully exiting the chat with `/exit`.
4. Do the iterative improvements to the agent to your intentions. 
5. Add your reflection to `lab03.md`.
> You can use the template in the [Step 1](#step-1) section below to structure your reflections. 

> Here is a link to a [Markdown cheatsheet]( https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) to help you with formatting your lab report.
6. Add `lab03_dnd_agent.py`, `lab03.md` and `attempts.txt` to your commit.
7. Submit your commit link to the lab03 submission on Canvas.

## Lab03 Grading Rubric

1. __Evidence of Iterative Improvement__: Measures how well each iteration builds on the previous, highlighting specific changes and improvements made along the way.

2. __Analytical Depth__: Looks at how thoroughly the student investigates the causes of issues or successes, using data or logical reasoning to guide conclusions.

3. __Clarity of Ideas__: Focuses on how effectively the student communicates their thought process, ensuring the reflection is organized and easy to follow.

## Example step

The [Step 1](#step-1) section below shows the format that you can use to write your reflections. You can copy and paste this section into your `lab03.md` file and fill it out as you go along for each iterative step.

### Step 1
#### Intention
>What is the improvement that you intend to make?

#### Action/Change
>Why do you think this action/change will improve the agent?

#### Result
>What was the result?

#### Reflection/Analysis of the result. 
>Why do you think it did or did not work?
