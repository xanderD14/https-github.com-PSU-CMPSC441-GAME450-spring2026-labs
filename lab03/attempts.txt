Assistant: Alright, gather 'round the fireplace, gather the kin, and let the magic flow! 

You stand sweating – a heavy wool cloth clinging to your shoulders. A single ember glows faintly in the ash smoke that swirls around your tunic. Steam curls upwards, misting your tired, spectral coat. Do you feel it?

"Sfumately illuminated," you murmur. "A faint warmth dances beneath the curve of my aubilliant emerald eyes. A palpable air hangs heavy with the ghosts we're inheriting… and a tantalizing anticipation!" 

You notice… the wind rustling through them...

"A gasp escapes your lips," you mutter.
