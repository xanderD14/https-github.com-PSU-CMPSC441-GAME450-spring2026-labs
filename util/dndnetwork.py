# dndnetwork.py
"""
This module contains the DungeonMasterServer class, which is a server that
manages a turn-based game for multiple connected clients. The server will
accept connections from clients, broadcast messages to all clients, and
manage the turn-based game loop. Each client is expected to send a message
to the server every turn to participate in the game. They are allowed to send
empty messages.

Players can also send '/quit' to gracefully exit the game. The server will
remove them from the game and close their connection. But it will continue
running the game loop until all players have left.
